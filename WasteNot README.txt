The 'Waste Not' talent has been adjusted and renamed. All voxel nodes now have a 1/2/3% chance to yield bonus resources: metal nodes will yield 
Exotics as their secondary resource, while stone, oxite, sulfur, and silica will yield more of the same as their secondary.

Installation instructions - after downloading file, go to:
C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks - if you have not already done so, create a folder in the Paks folder 
and name it 'mods'. Place the .pak file that you downloaded into the mods folder, and then you are good to go. This mod should be compatible 
with any other mod provided the same files are not changed (secondary resource type for stone/ores, and the Waste Not talent).
