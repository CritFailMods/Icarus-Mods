Top Tier Shengong envirosuits modified to noticeable different - one provides an "extreme survival" benefit, while the other provides a step up from
the Hark suit.

Cloth, Leather and Fur armor stats and set bonuses have been adjusted to be less suitable in the opposing extreme environments. Cloth is no longer a viable option in the arctic,
