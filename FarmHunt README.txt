CritFail FarmHunt v1

Farming Changes:
Even out plants into loot/time categories - if a recipe calls for 3 different plants, you should be able to get an even amount of resources
from an even amount of crop plots. Should not have twice as many carrot plots to squash/pumpkins. End result should be a base growth reward of
what you would get harvesting in the wild (based off of sickle value if possible) before the talent bonuses are factored in.

Greenhouse improvements:
Increased the durability of glass buildables to the level of stone so they arenâ€™t so fragile; adjusted crafting costs.

Cooking Changes: 
Adjust stack counts of plants, meats, and cooked recipes. All plants, meats, and cooked items have a stack count of 100.
Wheat/Flour stack count of 500.

Hunting Changes:
Adjust the loot rewards of various creatures to make it a bit better. Adjust ammo recipes to make more sense and craft stacks
of 5-10 instead of 1. Stack counts of ammo raised to 200. Leather/Fur stack counts 100, bone stack count 400.

Misc Changes:
Ores/ingots all stack to 100 
Fiber/Sticks stack to 500 
Stone/Wood stack to 200
