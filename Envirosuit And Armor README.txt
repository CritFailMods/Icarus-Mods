Installation instructions - after downloading file, go to:
C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks - if you have not already done so, create a folder in the Paks folder 
and name it 'mods'. Place the .pak file that you downloaded into the mods folder, and then you are good to go. Not compatible with any mod that alters 
envirosuits or armor base stats.

Changes:

Some Envirosuits have had their stats adjusted to give more variety. All Armor set bonuses have been adjusted to provide more variation
and purpose to them. Armor set items have been put back to vanilla until the new temperature changes are further tested and fleshed out.
