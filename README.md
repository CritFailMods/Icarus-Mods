# CritFail Mods

**Waste Not Mod**
* Changes the 'Waste Not' talent to the 'What's This?" custom talent with the following changes based on which version you install:
* PlatTi - 2/5/10% chance for Exotics as secondary resource from Platinum and Titanium ore veins (other ore rewards more of itself)
* ULTRA - 1/2/3% chance for Exotics as secondary resource from all metal ore nodes

**Linkarus Releveling Mod**
* Hosted here so as not to lose it - this mod adjusts level rewards so that you continue to earn Talent points past the level cap of 50. Does not reward additional Solo tree Talent points.
