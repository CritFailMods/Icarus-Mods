"Waste Not" talent upgrade (Exotics instead of Stone as the secondary resource)

This will have the following changes in-game - when you mine stone or any ore (iron, copper, gold etc. and oxite/silica/sulfur) there is a 1/2/3% chance (based on the number of points invested in the talen) of mining Exotics as a secondary resource. The amount earned does increase based on what pickaxe you are using (i.e. you will get more using the Inaris workshop pickaxe than anything else).

Installation instructions - after downloading file, go to:
C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks - if you have not already done so, create a folder in the Paks folder and name it 'mods'.
Place the .pak file that you downloaded into the mods folder, and then you are good to go. This mod should be compatible with any other mod provided the same files are not changed
(secondary resource type for stone/ores, and the Waste Not talent).
