CritFail_WasteNot_v2_P.pak -- "Waste Not" talent upgrade (Exotics instead of Stone as the secondary resource)

DISCLAIMER: this mod is intended for Offline and/or solo play. It can potentially ruin the game for others when playing together, so please do not put yourself in that situation. If you play with a regular group and they all want it, please recommend all parties install the mod to prevent adverse effects.

The 'Waste Not' talent has been adjusted and renamed. NOTE: It is now a ONE POINT talent, so if you currently have more than 1 point invested, I advise you to respec the extra points so that you do not lose them.

All voxel nodes now have a 1% chance to yield bonus resources: metal nodes will yield Exotics as their secondary resource, while stone, oxite, sulfur, and silica will yield more of the same as their secondary.

Installation instructions - after downloading file, go to:
C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks - if you have not already done so, create a folder in the Paks folder and name it 'mods'.
Place the .pak file that you downloaded into the mods folder, and then you are good to go. This mod should be compatible with any other mod provided the same files are not changed
(secondary resource type for stone/ores, and the Waste Not talent).
