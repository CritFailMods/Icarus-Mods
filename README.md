# CritFail Mods

Welcome to my collection of mods for Icarus: First Cohort. Below will be listed the various mods and a description of what they adjust. RECOMMENDED: Download the Icarus Mod Manager by Jim72. It will allow you to easily and conveniently install, remove, merge, and update any mods you use! Mods can be updated every week simply by updating the data folder and then updating the installed mods without the need to re-download versions of them. You can find it here: https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software

Also, head on over to the Linkarus Discord community for news, help, and other stuff regarding the modding community for the game!

DISCLAIMER: mods can cause issues when playing with others. Generally, use them for solo or offline play. If you intend to run mods with a group, insure that all party members have the same mods installed so that you do not run into any conflicts or bugs. Running mods in a group setting without everyone else running them can cause all sorts of problems (items missing, crashes, etc.)

**INSTALLATION:**
* If you do not already have one, you need to create a new folder and name it 'mods' in the following directory - Disk > Program Files (x86) > steamapps > common > Icarus > Icarus > Content > Paks. Download desired .pak files, and drag and drop into the mods folder you created. Good to go!
