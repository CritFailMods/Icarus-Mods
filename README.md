DISCLAIMER: mods can cause issues when playing with others. Generally, use them for solo or offline play. If you intend to run mods with a group, insure that all party members have the same mods installed so that you do not run into any conflicts or bugs. Running mods in a group setting without everyone else running them can cause all sorts of problems (items missing, crashes, etc.)

INSTALLATION: if you do not already have one, you need to create a new folder and name it 'mods' in the following directory - Disk > Program Files (x86) > steamapps > common > Icarus > Icarus > Content > Paks. Download desired .pak files, and drag and drop into the mods folder you created. Good to go!
