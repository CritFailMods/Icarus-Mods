# CritFail Mods

**Waste Not Mod**
* Changes the 'Waste Not' talent to the 'What's This?" custom talent - instead of giving you a chance to yield extra stone, it now yields more of the same material as what you are mining, except for Platinum and Titanium, which have a chance to yield Exotic Ore as a secondary resource. % chance reduced to 1% per point invested.

**Linkarus Releveling Mod**
* Hosted here so as not to lose it - this mod adjusts level rewards so that you continue to earn Talent points past the level cap of 50. Does not reward additional Solo tree Talent points.
